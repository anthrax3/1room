1 bed

Welcome to your new job!
Your task is to place furniture 
in our costumer's rooms.
First, place a bed here.
A quick look at the rules...
Beds need to be reachable 
from all doors.
Objects can be rotated 
with right click.
Drag them to the desired position.
Make sure not to block the doors...
Not quite easy, hmm.

Wow, faster than I thought.
