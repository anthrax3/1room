1 bed

Welcome to your new job!
Your task is to place furniture 
in our customers' rooms.
First, place a bed here.
A quick look at the rules...
Beds need to be reachable 
from all doors.
Objects can be rotated 
with a right click.
Drag them to the desired position.
Make sure not to block the doors...
Not quite easy, hmm.

Wow, faster than I thought.
